Answer the questions:

1. Nesting: How did you organize the additional details in the traveler field, and how does it improve the organization of the data overall?
    - I nested them by making the "traveler" field a nested object. Then since "contact" had two fields, I made it a
    nested object within "traveler" too, with the "phone" and "email" fields.

2. Arrays: For the destinations and activities, what data structure did you use? What impact did this decision have?
    - For "destinations" I used an array of objects. I also did an array of objects for "activities" too. Each object within "destinations" 
    has a "location", "arrivalDate", "departureDate", and "activities"— "activities" being an array. Each object in the "activities" array 
    has a "title" and "time".

3. Scalability: How could this JSON structure be expanded to include additional details, such as hotel information or transportation options?
    - Hotel information would be a field/key within each object in the "destinations" array, and would be an array itself since there are multiple 
    hotels to consider for each destination. The same with transportation. You just have to think about how the new information you want would fit in
    best. 

4. Real-World Application: How would this data be useful in a travel app or API?
    - It would be very useful in a travel app or API since whenever you type in a destination, you get the related information about that destination 
    like different activities to do, hotels nearby, and more.
